# ** Abstract Data Type **

## Stacks, Queues And Deque

- Codes in the project made inclusive of all the methods for enqueuing, dequeuing, peeking, and checking if the queue is empty in Queue implementation method.

- It also included methods for pushing, popping, peeking, and checking if the stack is empty.

- Make it throw an error if you try to pop from an empty stack.

### Further study

-  The use of a LinkedList class was used to re-implement internally to manage the queue elements.


###  Challenges

#### Browser Back/Forward
- A pseudo-code for a browser design for back/forward was outline using Stacks

#### String Reversal

- Using Stacks methods, a function that reverses a string by handling one letter at a time was implemented without the use of string-reversal built-in method.

#### Josephus Survivor

- There are 10 people numbered 1 to 10 standing in a circle. Starting with the first person, eliminate every third person. Continue looping through the circle until only one person remains.
